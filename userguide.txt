# User Guide: YouTube Video Automation Tool
This user guide aims to help you understand and use the automated tool for creating and uploading YouTube videos. The program combines script generation, text-to-speech, audio-video merging, and video uploading in a seamless workflow.
## **Overview**
This program simplifies the process of creating YouTube videos by automating the following tasks:
1. Generates a script using an AI model (pre-configured to provide scripts for the "Guess The Country" game format).
2. Converts the generated script into audio using text-to-speech.
3. Merges the audio with a pre-existing video to create the final video.
4. Uploads the final video to a YouTube channel.

## **Setup Instructions**
### 1. **Prerequisites**
Before running the program, ensure you have the following:
- Python installed on your system.
- Access to a YouTube account and its credentials.
- A video file that will act as the visual base (`input.mp4`).
- Necessary dependencies installed (see below).

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
Run the following command to install the required Python libraries:
``` bash
pip install langchain-ollama gtts moviepy google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client
```
### 3. **Obtain YouTube API Credentials**
1. Visit the [Google Cloud Console]().
2. Create a project and enable the **YouTube Data API v3**.
3. Download the `client_secret.json` file and place it in the project folder.
4. Ensure the program can access this file during execution.

## **How to Use**
### 1. **Prepare Resources**
- Place the base video (`input.mp4`) in the same directory as the program.
- Ensure `client_secret.json` (YouTube API credentials) is in the directory.

### 2. **Run the Program**
Execute the script with the following command:
``` bash
python main.py
```
### 3. **Authorize YouTube Access**
Upon running the program:
- A browser window will open asking for permission to access your YouTube account.
- Grant the required permissions to continue.

### 4. **Video Creation and Upload**
The program generates a video based on the script (for the "Guess The Country" game) and uploads it to your YouTube account. Once uploaded, the program displays a **Video ID**, confirming the upload.
## **Features and Customization**
### 1. **Customizing Video Topics**
Currently, the program is set up for the "Guess The Country" game. You can modify the **prompt** provided to the AI model to introduce other topics. Changes can be made in the script where:
``` python
model.invoke(input="Your custom prompt here")
```
### 2. **Modify Video Metadata**
You can customize the following metadata for the YouTube video directly in the script:
- **Video Title:** Modify the `title` variable.
- **Video Description:** Adjust the `description` variable.
- **Tags:** Update the `tags` list with keywords for the video.
- **Category:** Change the `category_id` to match your preferred YouTube category. (`22` is for "People & Blogs").

### 3. **Input Video**
Replace the `input.mp4` file with another video of your choice to use as the base visual.
## **Troubleshooting**
1. **Problem: Video upload fails**
    - Verify the `client_secret.json` file exists and is valid.
    - Ensure you have provided YouTube API authorization when prompted.

2. **Problem: Missing dependencies**
    - Ensure all required libraries are installed. Run the install command again if needed:
``` bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
```
1. **Problem: Script errors**
    - Ensure your Python version is compatible (preferably 3.8+).
    - Check the file paths for input and credentials.

## **Next Steps**
Using this tool, you can quickly create YouTube videos with minimal manual intervention. Customize the script to add more variety to your content or automate posting schedules.
For any modifications or scaling, look into:
- Scheduling the script with tools like CRON (for Linux) or Task Scheduler (for Windows).
- Expanding the topics by updating the AI model input prompt.

With this guide, you should now be ready to create and share amazing videos efficiently.
